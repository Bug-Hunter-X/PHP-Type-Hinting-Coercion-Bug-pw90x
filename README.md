This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to type hinting and type coercion. The `foo` function is declared to accept two integers, but the call to `foo` passes a string '2' as the second argument. PHP attempts to coerce '2' to an integer, but this behavior can lead to unexpected results in more complex scenarios.  The solution demonstrates a more robust approach using strict type checking.
